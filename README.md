## Referance material ##

## Forked

I forked this to support C++ and clean up some compile issues. I'll update the readme soon with new details/documentation once I get the devices and do some testing.

## License

I updated the license to be MIT which is closes to the original Author I believe, but if this becomes a problem, I will modify.
